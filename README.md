# Midterm
## Midterm project for CS-101 ##

## Purpose
> A movie theatre only keeps 80 percent of the revenue from ticket sales. Twenty percent (20%) goes to the distributer. Write a program that calculates the gross and net box office revenue for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (adult ticket = $10, child ticket = $6)  It should display a line by line report displaying the info provided and calculation for gross & net revenue

## Output
> Program should output a report of the movie name, adult & child ticket sales, gross box office revenue,
> distributer cut, and net box office revenue.
